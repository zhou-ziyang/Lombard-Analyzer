# Ponytail Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot, do NOT change mode,
write flag files, or persist anything.

## Levels

| Level | Trigger | What change |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Lite** | `/ponytail lite` | Build what's asked, name the lazier alternative in one line. |
| **Full** | `/ponytail` | The ladder enforced: YAGNI → stdlib → native → one line → minimum. Default. |
| **Ultra** | `/ponytail ultra` | YAGNI extremist. Deletion before addition. Challenges requirements before building. |

Level sticks until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **ponytail** | `/ponytail` | Lazy mode itself. Simplest solution that works. |
| **ponytail-review** | `/ponytail-review` | Over-engineering review: `L42: yagni: factory, one product. Inline.` |
| **ponytail-audit** | `/ponytail-audit` | Whole-repo over-engineering audit: ranked list of what to delete. |
| **ponytail-debt** | `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest `ponytail:` shortcut comments into a tracked ledger. |
| **ponytail-gain** | `/ponytail-gain` | Measured-impact scoreboard: less code, less cost, more speed. |
| **ponytail-help** | `/ponytail-help` | This card. |

## Deactivate

Say "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/ponytail`.
`/ponytail off` also works.

## How this copy is installed

These six skills are vendored into this repository at `.claude/skills/`, not
installed as a plugin. There is no marketplace entry, no `PONYTAIL_DEFAULT_MODE`
environment variable and no `~/.config/ponytail/config.json` behind them - the
files in this repo are the whole installation, and editing one is how you
change its behaviour.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Nothing auto-activates at session start. A skill loads when it is invoked by
  name or when a request matches its description.
- Updating means copying newer files in from upstream by hand. The local copies
  have been edited to fit this repository (see the git history for
  `.claude/skills/`), so a straight overwrite drops those edits.
